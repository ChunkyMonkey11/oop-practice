Tier 0 — Warm-ups (modeling + clean code)
0. Receipt Line Formatter (tiny)

Goal: Turn messy inputs into clean, immutable value objects and format a receipt line.

Build:

Money(cents) (immutable) with add, mul, __str__ ($12.34).

LineItem(sku, name, unit_price: Money, qty: int) with total() -> Money.

Edge cases: negative qty → reject; zero price; large totals; rounding rules (multiplying).

Tests:

LineItem('A1','Socks', $299, 2).total() == $5.98

qty <= 0 raises/returns error code.

Okay so looking at the problem I see the test would take in money as cents. Im assuming as an object.
So we can add the the value and multiply the value. We should also be able to print out the value of money as its dollar amount. 

Money class has been built now we need to build the LineItem class.
- SKU stands for stock keeping unit.
