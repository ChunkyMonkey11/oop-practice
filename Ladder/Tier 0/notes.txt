What did I learn from Reciept_Line_Form???

Well what did we even code?

We wrote two classes. One called Money and the other LineItem

Money:
    The class Money reperesents Money as an object
    this object has three methods. One to add, One to multiply,
    and one to handle the string repersentation of the object.

    -add:
        - This returns a new Money Object that takes the current value in cents and adds a variable called amount.
        Returns a new money object with the added amount
    -multiply:
        - This returns a new Money Object that takes the current amount of money and 
        multiplys it by a scale amount. Returns a new Money Object

    -__str__ :
        - This returns the Money Object formatted as a string. But also
        divides the cents /100 to get the dollar value. 

LineItem:
    The LineItem reperesents the LineItem as an object.
    Has a constructor and a method called total.
    It takes in a few parameters but most importantly it takes in
    the Money Object as a parameter.

    -total:
        - returns the total dollar amount of a lineitem.
