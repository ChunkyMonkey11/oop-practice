Exercise 3: Build a class Employee with multiple constructors that can initialize an employee object in different ways.

Completition Notes:
    - This problem was easy. To solve it create a Employee class which contains three attirbutes name, age, company.
    Set the intial values of these in the definiton parameters.
    (name="John Doe", age=21, company="N/A")
    - We used the __str__ method to reperesent the employee class as a string. This lets us print(Employee) in a formatted string.
