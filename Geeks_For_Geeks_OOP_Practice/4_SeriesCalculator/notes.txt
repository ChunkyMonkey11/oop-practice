Exercise 4: Design a class SeriesCalculator that calculates the sum of an arithmetic series.

Completition Notes:
- This problem was a medium for me because I did not understand the formula.
    - After reviewing the solution I understand how the formula gets encorporated into code.
    - I had tried to create an intialization of the class but it doesn't make sense to since this class doesn't rely 
    on previous values or attributes but rather each operation uses the values once. So instead we created one method within
    the calculator that will calculate the sum of the arithmtic series.
    - It is worth trying the formula out on paper once to understand the calculation and the computation. Use this in future 
    problems.
